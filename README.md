This mini CMS is in alpha, so there's no doc yet. ðŸ˜… 

But basically:  
- It unzips on a server with php.
- The content is in the "content" folder, it's __Markdown__ with a __YAML header__.
- If you add a file to this folder, it automatically creates a page with the theme chosen in the conf file.

It's ultra-basic. I'd be interested to hear about your experiences using it.
